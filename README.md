# PW Projects

This repository contains my projects from the course "Concurrent Programming".

## Overview

PW stands for "Programowanie Współbieżne" in Polish, which translates to
"Concurrent Programming". This repository includes my projects from this course.
I completed projects one and three, which fulfilled the requirements for the
course.

## Project Descriptions

Below is the list of short project descriptions:

1. **Concurrent Workshop Coordination in Java**: Implement a Concurrent Workshop
coordination system in Java for managing shared workstations. The system is
inspired by the concept of sharing economy, where potentially expensive
resources are shared among participants to reduce costs. The objective is to
implement a coordination mechanism for users accessing the workstations
according to specified requirements. Users can enter the workshop, use
workstations, switch workstations if needed, and leave the workshop when
finished.

3. **Circus Restaurant Management System in C++**: Develop a Circus Restaurant
Management System in C++ for handling various aspects of restaurant operations,
including order management, machine failures, and employee reports. Customers
can place orders, check the available menu items, and receive a coaster pager
device indicating when their order is ready for pickup. Additionally, the system
handles scenarios such as machine failures, where customers are notified and
affected products are removed from the menu. It also manages cases where
customers fail to collect their orders within a specified time, allowing the
products to be reissued to other customers.

Please refer to the respective project directories for detailed solutions.
